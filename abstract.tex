    This paper takes an in depth look into a variety of cryptography methods in 
    order to determine their compatibility in a live chat application. The goal of 
    encrypting data is to make it secure such that if the data is comprised, it is
    not at risk. 
    
    This paper also evaluates the security of different cryptography methods and 
    their relation to a live chat application. A basic live chat application is
    built and applied to the various algorithms discussed within this paper. 
    Comparisons of both theoretical and practical results are given in order to 
    better understand the algorithms viability.
